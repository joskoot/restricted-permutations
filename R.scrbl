@section{Introduction}
In this docu@(-?)ment the word `permutation' is used in mathematical sense,
id est, such as to mean a bijection of a set onto the same set.

@elemtag["rearrangement" ""]
@note{The word `permutation' often is used for rearrangements.
For example, two lists like @nb{(1 2 0)} and @nb{(0 1 2)}
often are called permutations of each other.
In this docu@(-?)ment they are called rearrange@(-?)ments of each other,
the word `permutation' being reserved for bijections of a set onto the same set.
Rearrange@(-?)ments can represent permutations, though.
If there is no danger of confusion,
a representing object can be written or talked about
as though it were the object it represents,
@nb{but this} is avoided in this docu@(-?)ment.
However, no formal distinction will be made between
@nbsl["numbers"
#:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")
"exact integer numbers of Racket"]
and the abstract integer numbers they represent.
@nb{See section} @nbsl["N" "Natural/integer numbers"].}

@elemtag["R" ""]
Let @bold{N} be the set of all natural numbers, 0 included.
Define a restricted permutation, @nb{say p},
as a permutation of @bold{N} with the following restriction:

@inset{@nb{∃m∈@bold{N}: ∀k∈@bold{N}: k≥m @⇒ p(k) = k}}

Let's call the least natural number m for which the restriction holds
@italic{the} restriction of p.
`R' is shorthand for `restricted permutation'
and `@bold{R}' for `the set of all Rs'.
@elemtag["composition"]Define the composition:

@inset{@nb{p,q∈@bold{R} → pq∈@bold{R}}}

as usual for functions p and q with compatible range of q and domain of p:

@inset{@nb{pq: k∈@bold{N} → p@larger{(}q(k)@larger{)}∈@bold{N}}}

@bold{R} always will be associated with this composition,
thus forming a @nber["group"]{group},
in particular a denumerable infinite group.
As required, the composition is associative.
For some groups the composition is commutative.
For @bold{R} it is not,
although it is commutative for many subgroups of @bold{R},
but certainly not for all of them.
For every finite group, @bold{R} has an isomorphic subgroup.

@note{In fact exactly one such subgroup
consisting of the @nber["id"]{identity of @bold{R}} only
if the order @nb{(= cardinality)} of the group is 1 and
an infinite number of them if the order is greater than 1.}

@note{@elemtag["group"]{The present document is not an introduction to group theory.
It refers to mathematical concepts without their definitions and
mentions theorems without their proofs.
For a simple introduction see chapters 1 and 2 of
@nbhl[
 (string-append
  "https://ia800307.us.archive.org/18/items/"
  "GroupTheoryAndItsApplicationToPhysicalProblems/"
  "Hamermesh-GroupTheoryAndItsApplicationToPhysicalProblems.pdf")
 "Group Theory by Morton Hamermesh"].
If you know nothing about quantum mechanics,
you'd better skip the introduction.
Quantum mechanics play no role in chapter 1, nor in chapter 2.
As an alternative see @nbhl["finite-groups.doc" "finite-groups.doc"].}}

Let p and q be two Rs with restrictions r@↓{p} and r@↓{q} and
let r@↓{pq} be the restriction of the composition pq.
We have @nb{0 ≤ r@↓{pq} ≤ max(r@↓{p}@bold{,}r@↓{q}).}
The restriction of pq not necessarily equals that of qp.
See the @nber["P-example"]{example}
in the description of procedure @nbr[P-compose].

@elemtag["id" "The identity"] of @bold{R} is:

@inset{@nb{∀k∈@bold{N}: k → k}}

This is the only R with restriction 0 and @nbrl[P-order "order"] 1.
For every other R the restriction and order are greater than 1,
but always finite. They are not necessarily the same.
@nbrl[P-inverse]{Inverses} of each other have the same order and restriction.
There are n! Rs with restriction less than or equal to natural @nb{number n}.
These form a finite subgroup of @bold{R} isomorphic to the
@nbhl["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group"]{symmetric group} S@↓{n}.

@note{In every group, not only in @bold{R},
the identity is the only element of order 1 and
inverses of each other have the same order.}

@note{There is no R with restriction 1.
If p is a permutation of @bold{N}
with @nb{∀k∈@bold{N}: k≥1 @⇒ p(k) = k}, then @nb{p(0) = 0}
and hence @nb{∀k∈@bold{N}: p(k) = k},
which means that p is the identity with restriction 0.@(lb)
Let @nb{a(m)} be the number of Rs with restriction m.@(lb)
We have: @nb{a(0)=1} and @nb{∀m∈@bold{N}: a(m+1) = (m+1)!@(minus)m! = mm!}.
This implies: @nb{a(1) = 0.}
Furthermore: @nb{@larger{Σ}@↓{(m=0@bold{..}n)}a(m) = n!},
where m runs from 0 up to and including n.}

@note{Do not confuse the @nbrl[P-order]{order of an element}
with the @nbrl[G-order]{order of a group}.@(lb)
The latter is the cardinality of a group,
but it usually is called its @italic{order}.@(lb)
The word `order' also is used for the consecution of elements in a list or vector.@(lb)
In most cases it is clear with which meaning the word is used.@(lb)
Where there is danger of confusion, a phrase is used that avoids confusion.}

An R is an abstract mathematical concept.@(lb)
The following @nber["representations" "representations"]
in terms of Racket objects are used:

@inset{@tabular[#:sep (list (hspace 1) ":" (hspace 1))
(list
 (list "P" @seclink["P"]{Function-representation of Rs})
 (list "C" @seclink["C"]{Cycle-representation of Rs})
 (list "H" @seclink["H"]{Hash-representation of Rs})
 (list "G" @seclink["G"]{Representation of finite subgroups of @bold{R}}))]}

@note{Hs are for internal use behind the screen. @red{Advice}: avoid explicit use of Hs.}

@note{@elemtag["representations"]{
In this docu@(-?)ment the word `representation' refers to the way abstract mathematical concepts
are expressed in terms of Racket objects.
In group theory the word has quite another meaning
(group of coordinate transformations in a linear space).
In this docu@(-?)ment the word is not used with the group theoretical meaning.}}

Notice that

@inset{
 @racketblock0[
(lambda ([k : Natural]) (code:comment #,(element 'roman (red "This is not an R.")))
 ((if (even? k) add1 sub1) k))]}

can represent a permutation of @bold{N} but does not represent an R
because it does not satisfy the above @nber["R" "restriction"].

@section[#:tag "N"]{Natural/integer numbers}

The
@nbsl[
"numbers"
#:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")
"exact integer numbers of Racket"]
represent their abstract mathematical counter@(-?)parts exactly.
Although the representation is not complete because of memory and performance limits,
no distinction is needed between abstract integer numbers and
the exact integer numbers of Racket by which they are represented nor between
@nbrl[exact-nonnegative-integer? "exact non-negative integers of Racket"]
and the corresponding abstract natural numbers.

@bold{N} is the set of all natural numbers,
@bold{N@↑{+}} the set of all positive natural numbers and
@bold{Z} the set of all integer numbers.
The following synonyms are provided by module @nbhl["N.rkt" "N.rkt"].
They are used in the description of the procedures shown in this docu@(-?)ment,
particularly in their specifications of data types:

@deftogether[
 (@defproc[#:kind "predicate" (N?  (x any/c)) boolean?]
  @defproc[#:kind "predicate" (N+? (x any/c)) boolean?]
  @defproc[#:kind "predicate" (Z?  (x any/c)) boolean?])]{

   (@nbr[N+?]   @nbr[exact-positive-integer?]    @nbr[free-identifier=?])
   (@nbr[Z?]    @nbr[exact-integer?]             @nbr[free-identifier=?]))
  #:sep (hspace 3)
  #:row-properties (list '(top-border bottom-border) '() '() 'bottom-border)]}

@note{In this document @bold{R} is the group of @nber["R"]{restricted permutations}.@(lb)
It has nothing to do with the set of real numbers.}

@section[#:tag "C"]{Cycle notation}

All objects described in this section are defined in module @nbhl["C.rkt" "C.rkt"].
`C' is shorthand for `cycle notation'.
A C represents an @nber["R" "R"] and is one of the following:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
(list
 @item{
  A single C, which is a list of distinct @nbsl["N"]{natural numbers}.
  It represents the @nber["R" "R"]
  that maps each element of the list onto the next one, the last element onto the first one
  and every @nbsl["N"]{natural number} that is not part of the single C onto itself. 
  The empty list and every single C of one element represent the
  @nber["id"]{identity} of @nber["R"]{@bold{R}}.
  The @nber["id"]{identity} has @nbrl[P-order "order"] 1.
  A non-empty single C of n elements represents an @nber["R" "R"] of @nbrl[P-order "order"] n.
  The @racket[reverse] of a single C represents the @nbrl[P-inverse]{inverse}
  of the @nber["R" "R"] represented by the original single C.}
 @item{
  A list of Cs.
  Represents the @nber["composition" "composition"] of the @nber["R" "Rs"] represented
  by its elements. An element of a list of Cs can be a list of Cs, but
  superfluous pairs of parentheses can be ignored,
  because the @nber["composition" "composition"] is associative.
  The order in which the single Cs appear in the list can be relevant,
  because they are not required to commute with each other.})]

@elemtag["normalized-C"]{A normalized C is one of the following:}

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
(list
 @item{
  The empty list. It is the one and only normalized C representing the
  @nber["id"]{identity of @bold{R}}.}
 @item{
  A single C of at least two elements and the first element being the least one.
  @nb{A circular} shift of a single C represents the same @nber["R" "R"]
  as the original single C.
  Therefore a non-normalized single C of at least two elements can be normalized
  by shifting it circularly until its least element is in front.}
 @item{
  A list of two or more disjunct non-empty normalized single Cs
  sorted in increasing order of their lengths
  and among normalized single Cs of the same length
  in increasing order of the first element.
  Sorting is possible because @nber["R" "Rs"] represented by disjunct single Cs
  commute with each other.
  The @nbrl[P-order "order"] of the represented @nber["R" "R"]
  is the least common multiple of the lengths of the single Cs.})]

For every @nber["R" "R"] there is a multitude of representing Cs
but exactly one representing normalized C only
(in the sense of @nbr[equal?] and ignoring memory limits).
See procedure @nbr[C-normalize] for examples.

@deftogether[
 (@defproc[#:kind "predicate" (C?            (x any/c)) boolean?]
  @defproc[#:kind "predicate" (C-normalized? (x any/c)) boolean?])]{
Predicate @nbr[C?] does not discriminate between normalized and non-normalized Cs.@(lb)
Predicate @nbr[C-normalized?] returns @nbr[#t] for @nber["normalized-C" "normalized Cs"] only.}

@defproc[(C-normalize (c C?)) C-normalized?]{
Returns the normalized form of its argument.
Examples:}

@example-table[
(C-normalize '(1 0))
(C-normalize '(1 2 0))
(C-normalize '((1 2) (0 3)))
(C-normalize '((0 2) (0 1)))
(C-normalize '((0 1) (0 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 1) (0 1 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 2) (0 1 2)))
(C-normalize '((1 2) (0 1 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (0 1)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (0 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (1 2)))
(C-normalize '(0 1 2 3))
(C-normalize '(1 2 3 0))
(C-normalize '(2 3 0 1))
(C-normalize '(3 0 1 2))
(C-normalize '((0 1) (1 2) (2 3)))
(C-normalize '((() () ())))
(C-normalize '(((9))))
(C-normalize '((1) (2) (3)))
(C-normalize '((0 1) (0 1)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (3 4)))
(C-normalize '((4 2 3) (1 0)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (0 1 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (2 1 0)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (1 2 3)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (2 3 4)))
(C-normalize '((0 1 2) (2 3 0)))]

The Cs shown below represent the same @nber["R" "R"].
Therefore @nbr[C-normalize] produces the same normalized C for them
@nb{(in the sense of @nbr[equal?])}:

@example-table[
(C-normalize '((0 1) (1 2)))
(C-normalize '((0 2) (0 1)))
(C-normalize '((1 2) (0 2)))
(C-normalize '(0 1 2))
(C-normalize '(1 2 0))
(C-normalize '(2 0 1))]

@defproc[(C-identity? (x any/c)) boolean?]{
Same as @nbr[(and (C? x) (null? (C-normalize x)))]}

@defproc[(C-transpositions (c C?)) C?]{
Returns a list of normalized transpositions
representing the same @nber["R" "R"] as the argument.
A transposition is a single C of two elements.
For every C there is a list of transpositions
representing the same @nber["R" "R"].
In most cases the @nber["R" "R"]s represented by the transpositions do not commute.
Hence the order in which the transpositions appear in the list usually is relevant.
The list of transpositions is not uniquely defined.
@nbr[C-transpositions] returns one only,
but always the same one (in the sense of @nbr[equal?])
for Cs representing the same @nber["R" "R"]
and with no more transpositions than necessary.

@elemtag["parity"]@note{A C that can be written as a list of an even number of transpositions
cannot be written as a list of an odd number of transpositions and vice versa.
Hence every C, and consequently every @nber["R" "R"], has well defined @nbrl[P-even? "parity"].
Composition of two @nber["R" "Rs"] with the same parity yields an even @nber["R" "R"].
Composition of two @nber["R" "Rs"] with opposit parity yields an odd @nber["R" "R"].
The @nber["id"]{identity of @bold{R}} has even parity.
@nb{A finite group} containing at least one odd element has as many odd ones as even ones.
The subset of all even elements of a finite group is an
@nbrl[G-invariant-subg? "invariant subgroup"].}}

Examples:

@example-table[
(C-transpositions '())
(C-transpositions '(0 1))
(C-transpositions '(0 1 2))
(C-transpositions '(2 1 0))
(C-transpositions '(0 1 2 3))
(C-transpositions '(0 1 2 3 4))
(C-transpositions '(1 2 3 4 0))
(C-transpositions '(2 3 4 0 1))
(C-transpositions '((0 1) (2 3)))
(C-transpositions '((2 3) (0 1)))
(C-transpositions '((0 1) (0 1)))
(C-transpositions '((0 1 2) (3 4 5)))
(C-transpositions '((3 4 5) (0 1 2)))]

The Cs shown in the example below represent the same @nber["R" "R"].
Therefore procedure @nbr[C-transpositions] produces the same list of transpositions for them
(in the sense of @nbr[equal?]):

@example-table[
(C-transpositions '((0 1) (1 2)))
(C-transpositions '((0 2) (0 1)))
(C-transpositions '((1 2) (0 2)))
(C-transpositions '(0 1 2))
(C-transpositions '(1 2 0))
(C-transpositions '(2 0 1))]

Because every @nber["R" "R"] represented by a transposition equals its inverse,
reversal of the list of transpositions always produces a C representing the inverse.
This implies that inverses of each other have the same parity.
Example:

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(for/and ((p (in-G (G-symmetric 4))))
 (define c (P->C p))
 (define transpositions (C-transpositions c))
 (and
  (eq? (P-even? p) (P-even? (P-inverse p)))
  (C-identity? (list transpositions (reverse transpositions)))))]

@defproc[(H->C (h pseudo-H?)) C-normalized?]{
Returns the normalized C representing the same @nber["R" "R"] as @nbr[h].@(lb)
You probably never need this procedure.@(lb)@nb{@red{Advice: avoid it}.}}

@defproc[(C->H (c C?)) H?]{
Returns an @nbsl["H" "H"] representing the same @nber["R" "R"] as @nbr[c].@(lb)
You probably never need this procedure.@(lb)@nb{@red{Advice: avoid it}.}}

@section[#:tag "P"]{Function representation}

All objects described in this section are defined in
module @nbhl["P.rkt" "P.rkt"].
A P is a procedure @nbr[(-> N? N?)] representing an @nber["R" "R"].
Given the same argument, a P returns the same @seclink["N"]{natural number}
as the represented @nber["R" "R"], of course.
For every @nber["R" "R"] there is a representing P (ignoring memory limits).
Although Ps are procedures,
those representing the same @nber["R" "R"] are the same in the sense of @nbr[eq?].
@red{Warning}: this may not remain true after @nbsl["Cleanup" "cleanup"].
In fact Ps are
@nbsl["structures" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl") "structures"]
with @nbrl[prop:procedure "procedure property"].
A P is idenified by its @nbsl["H" "H-representation"].
It memorizes its normalized @nbsl["C" "C-representation"],
its @nber["parity"]{parity},
its @nbrl[P-order #:style #f]{order},
its @nbrl[P-period #:style #f]{period} and
its @nbrl[P-inverse #:style #f]{inverse},
but only after they have been needed for the first time.
A P is written, printed or displayed in @constr-style as:

@inset{@nb{@elem[#:style 'tt]{(@nbr[P] @bold{@literal{'}}@italic{c})}}}

where @elem[#:style 'tt @italic{c}] is the normalized @nbsl["C" "C-representation"].
@(lb)An exception is made for the @nbr[P-identity], which is written as:

@inset{@nbr[P-identity]}

which can be regarded as @constr-style too.

@deftogether[
 (@defproc[(P (p (or/c P? C?)) ...) P?]
  @defproc[(P-compose (p (or/c P? C?)) ...) P?])]{
@nbr[P-compose] is a synonym of @nbr[P] in the sense of @nbr[free-identifier=?].
Both return the P representing the @nber["R" "R"]
formed by @nber["composition" "composition"] of the
@nber["R" "Rs"] represented by the arguments.
If no argument is given, the @nbr[P-identity] is returned.
If only one argument is given, the returned P represents the same
@nber["R" "R"] as the argument.

Examples:}

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(define p (P '(2 3) '(4 5 6)))
(for ((k (in-range 10))) (printf "p(~s) = ~s~n" k (p k)))]

@example-table[
(P)
(P '())
(P '(0 1) '(0 1))
(P '(((0 1) (0 1))))
(P '(0 1))
(P '(1 0))
(P '(0 1) '(2 3 4))
(P '(0 1 2 3))
(P '(1 2 3 0))
(P '(2 3 0 1))
(P '(3 0 1 2))
(P '(0 1) '(1 2) '(2 3))
(P '(2 3) '(1 2) '(0 1))]

Let's do a check that two Ps representing the same @nber["R" "R"]
are the same in the sense of @nbr[eq?]
(assuming that no disturbing @nbsl["Cleanup" "cleanup"] is made)

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(define a (P '(3 4) '(4 5)))
(define b (P '(4 5 3)))
(code:comment #,(list "a and b represent the same " (elemref "R" "R") ":"))
(code:line (for/and ((k (in-range 10))) (= (a k) (b k))) (code:comment #,(green "ok")))
(code:comment "Hence:")
(code:line (eq? a b) (code:comment #,(green "ok")))]

Another example:

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(define p (P '((0 2) (3 4 5))))
(define q (P-inverse p))
q
(code:comment "Because p and q are the inverses of each other, we have:")

(proper-subset? rotation-classes conj-classes)]

The group of all cube-symmetries has ten conjugation classes,
of which five are the conjugation classes of subgroup @tt{rotations-only}.
Elements belonging to the same class have the same normalized cycle structure,
but distinct classes can have the same normalized cycle structure.
@note{In a @nbrl[G-symmetric]{symmetric} group
every class has distinct normalized cycle structure.}
In group @tt{cube-symmetries} the inversion-symmetry,
rotations about 180° and reflections in the planes
containing the center of the cube and parallel to a side of the cube
have the same normalized cycle structure, but form distinct conjugation classes.
The @nbr[P-identity] always is the only member of its class.
The inversion-symmetry @nbr[(P '((0 6) (1 7) (2 4) (3 5)))],
which does not occur in subgroup @element['tt "rotations-only"], is lonesome too.
This implies that it commutes with all elements.
It maps each vertex to the one in opposit position with respect to the center of the cube.
Possibly you did not expect three-fold rotation axes as symmetries of a cube, but they are there.
Even subgroup @element['tt "rotations-only"] has threefold symmetries.
In particular, @nber["composition" "composition"] of two rotations about 90° with intersecting
axes orthogonal to each other produces a rotation about 120°, for example:

@example/n[(P-compose (P '((0 1 2 3) (4 5 6 7))) (P '((0 3 7 4) (1 2 6 5))))]

This is a rotation about 120° around axis 0-6.
Composition of this rotation with the inversion-symmetry,
which is not part of subgroup @element['tt "rotations-only"], produces:

@example/n[(P-compose (P '((1 3 4) (2 7 5))) (P '((0 6) (1 7) (2 4) (3 5))))]

This is a symmetry of order 6.
Let's check that the inversion-symmetry commutes with all symmetries of the cube:

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(define rotation (P '((0 1 2 3) (4 5 6 7))))
(define reflection (P '((0 7) (1 6))))
(define cube-symmetries (G rotation reflection))
(define inversion-symmetry (P '((0 6) (1 7) (2 4) (3 5))))
(for/and ((p (in-G cube-symmetries)))
 (eq?
  (P inversion-symmetry p)
  (P p inversion-symmetry)))]

There are @nb{9×24 = 216} distinct minimal bases for the symmetries of the cube.
They can be grouped in 9 collections of symmetrically equivalent minimal bases,
each collection containing 24 bases.
Two minimal bases @nb{{a ...}} and @nb{{b ...}} are symmetrically equivalent
if the group contains a symmetry x such that @nb{{ax ...} = {xb ...}}.
(This is an equality of two sets:
the order in which the elements appear between the curly brackets is irrelevant.)
It is not difficult to prove that this indeed is an equivalence relation of the minimal bases.
Symmetrically equivalent minimal bases have the same normalized cycle structure.
The number of collections of symmetrically equivalent minimal bases of the group of
@tt{cube-symmetries} is one less than the number of conjugation classes.
This is no coincidence, because both the identity and the inversion-symmetry
leave every minimal base as it is and are the only ones that commute with all symmetries.

@elemtag["seq" ""]
The number of minimal bases in a collection of symmetrically equivalent
minimal bases of group @tt{cube-symmetries} equals the order of group @tt{rotations-only}.
Indeed, for every pair of symmetrically equivalent minimal bases
there is a @tt{rotations-only}-symmetry showing the equivalence.
In addition, given a minimal base, every @tt{rotations-only}-symmetry
produces a dictinct symmetrically equivalent minimal base.
The following example shows the details:

We have
@tt["ii=jj=kk=-1"],
@tt["ij=k"],

and @tt["ki=j"].@(lb)
With these @nber["composition" "compositions"]
all others are defined as shown in the following table:

@note{This table has been @italic{computed} in module @nbhl["R.scrbl" "R.scrbl"].
It has @italic{not} been typed @italic{manually}.}

Because @element['tt "1"] is the identity, it commutes with all elements.
@element['tt "-1"] commutes with all elements too,
which is verified by the fact that the second row of the table
equals the second column.
Notice that
@nb[@element['tt "ji=(-ii)ji=-i(ij)i=-iki=-ij=-k"]].@(lb)
Likewise @nb[@element['tt "kj=-i"]] and @nb[@element['tt "ik=-j"]].
The @nbrl[G-classes "conjugation classes"] are:

@nested[#:style 'inset]{@verbatim|{

{i, -i}
{j, -j}
{k, -k}}|}

We can verify this as follows:

@subsection[#:tag "C3v"]{Group C@↓{3v}}

C@↓{3v} is the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle,
with subscript `3' indicating that it has a three-fold axis of rotation and
subscript `v' indicating it has a vertical plane of reflection containing
the axis of rotation and one of the vertices, in fact three such reflections
and assuming the triangle to be located in a horizontal plane.
Naming the vertices 0, 1 and 2 we can map the symmetries isomorphically onto @nber["R" "Rs"]:

@interaction[
(require racket "R.rkt")
(define C3v (G '(0 1) '(0 1 2)))
(G-print-table C3v)
(code:comment #,(list "C" (↓ "3v") " is isomorphic to S" (↓ "3") ". In this case we even have:"))
(eq? C3v (G-symmetric 3))]

The represented symmetries are:

@elemtag["C3v-table" ""]
@inset{@Tabular[
(("label" (nbsl "C" "C") "symmetry")
 ("0"     @nbr[()]       "the identity")

 ("2"     @nbr[(0 2 1)]  "rotation about 120° in reversed direction")
 ("3"     @nbr[(1 2)]    "reflection in perpendicular from vertex 0")

According to @nbhl["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem" "Cayley's theorem"]
every group of finite order m is isomorphic to
a subgroup of the symmetric group S@↓{m}.
For every group, every row of the table of @nber["composition" "composition"]s
is a distinct @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangement"] of the elements of the group.
Likewise every column is a distinct @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangement"].
Therefore every element of a group @bold{X}
can be associated with one or two permutations of set @bold{X}:

@inset{
∀x∈@bold{X}: (y∈@bold{X}: → xy) is a permutation of set @bold{X} (column of x)@(lb)
∀x∈@bold{X}: (y∈@bold{X}: → yx) is a permutation of set @bold{X} (row of x)}

If the group is abelean, the @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangements"]
in the rows are the same as those in the columns.
Hence, if the group is abelean, every element corresponds to one permutation only,
else some elements correspond to two distinct permutations of @bold{X}.
Because C@↓{3v} is not abelean, the set of @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangements"]
in the rows is not the same as that in the columns:
the table is not invariant under transposition, id est, reflection
in the diagonal from the upper left corner to the lower right corner.
Labeling the elements of C@↓{3v}
as shown in the @nber["C3v-table" "table"] above,
the @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangements"] in columns and those in rows
can be expressed as @nbsl["C" "Cs"].
Both sets of @nbsl["C" "Cs"] form groups isomorphic to C@↓{3v}.
Let's check this:

@(define C3v-comment1 "procedure correspondence computes a list of Ps corresponding to the")

@(define C3v-comment2
(list
 @nber["rearrangement" "rearrangements"]
 " of g in the rows/columns of its composition table."))

@subsection[#:tag "C3h"]{Group C@↓{3h}}

Group C@↓{3h} has a three-fold axis of rotation and a plane of reflection
perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The subscript `h' indicates that
with vertical axis of rotation, the plane of reflection is horizontal.
A minimal base of C@↓{3h} consists of one element only.
This implies that C@↓{3h} is circular and abelean.
There are two minimal bases (consisting of inverses of each other)
C@↓{3h} is isomorphic to the group of the natural numbers from 0 up to 6 (excluded),
0 as identity and addition modulo 6 as @nber["composition" "composition"].
